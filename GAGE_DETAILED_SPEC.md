# Gage App Specification: Part 1 - Onboarding & Foundations

This document is the first of a three-part series providing a comprehensive blueprint for the Gage AI Health Coach application. This part covers the core concept and provides a deep dive into the user's first experience: the Onboarding Journey.

## 1. Core Concept & Design Philosophy

### 1.1. Concept Overview

Gage is a premium health and wellness application that redefines the journey to personal fitness. It transcends traditional metric-tracking by integrating a powerful, agentic AI into a gamified, cinematic user experience. The core of the app is the "super-coach," an AI that provides proactive, real-time guidance based on a holistic analysis of a user's biometric, nutritional, and performance data collected via a proprietary wearable.

The user's journey is visualized as a solo climb up a unique, procedurally generated virtual mountain. The summit represents the achievement of the user's specific goal—whether that's increasing golf swing distance by 15 yards, adding 50 pounds to a deadlift, or running a marathon. The AI analyzes the user's goal, breaks it down into required activity points and milestones, and plots a personalized path up the mountain. Every action—a completed workout, a consistent sleep schedule, a well-balanced meal—earns activity points that translate directly into progress up the mountain. This creates a powerful, intrinsic motivation system where progress is not just a number on a chart, but a tangible, visual ascent toward their personal goal at the summit.

### 1.2. Design System: "The Glass Ascent"

The user interface is a fusion of two core aesthetics: the atmospheric, cinematic minimalism of Mont Fort and the tactile, layered "glassmorphism" of modern UI design. This creates an experience that is both immersive and intuitively functional. The UI elements float like panes of frosted glass over a stunning, dynamic mountain landscape.

Color Palette: Dominated by a dynamic mountainscape background, translucent Frosted Glass cards, soft Alpine Mist text, a vibrant Cyan/Teal accent for action, and a calm Glacial Blue accent for recovery.

Typography: A clean, geometric sans-serif (e.g., Circular Std) is used in Bold, Regular, and Light weights to establish a clear hierarchy.

Card Style & Interactivity: Translucent cards with a 1px border, a subtle glimmer effect, and a soft drop shadow. Tapping provides haptic feedback and a subtle scaling animation.

## 2. The Onboarding Journey: A Detailed Step-by-Step Walkthrough

The onboarding process is designed to be an immersive, elegant, and engaging experience. It introduces the user to the app's core mechanics and aesthetic from the very first tap. The entire flow takes place against a backdrop of a slowly materializing wireframe mountain, which grows in detail with each completed step.

### Step 1: Welcome Screen

**Visuals**: The screen opens on the faint, initial wireframe outline of the mountain against the deep charcoal background. A single, large "Frosted Glass" card animates into the center of the screen.

**Card Content**:

Headline: "Begin Your Ascent." (Bold, large font)

Body Text: "Welcome to Gage. We will now plot a personalized path to your peak. Your journey is unique, built from your goals and biometrics."

Button: A large, pill-shaped button at the bottom of the card with the text "Start Plotting." The button has a translucent fill and a Cyan/Teal border.

Animation: Tapping "Start Plotting" causes the button to fill with the Cyan/Teal color. The entire card then smoothly animates downwards and fades out, revealing the next card which animates up from the bottom.

### Step 2: Biometrics

**Visuals**: The wireframe mountain becomes slightly more defined. A new card appears, titled "Your Foundation."

**Card Content**: A series of highly interactive controls.

Age/Height/Weight: These are presented as three interactive "dials" or "rollers," not simple text fields. The user swipes vertically on each to select the number. The active number is larger and glows with Alpine Mist, while the inactive ones are smaller and dimmer.

Gender: Presented as selectable chips ("Male," "Female," "Other"). The selected chip fills with a translucent Cyan/Teal and has a solid cyan border.

Icons: A minimalist User icon from Lucide-React is displayed in the card's header next to the title.

Animation: As the user interacts with each control, the wireframe mountain subtly gains new vertices and lines, visually connecting their input to the creation of their path.

### Step 3: Activity & Lifestyle

**Visuals**: A new card, "Your Pace," animates in. The mountain wireframe now shows rough topographical lines.

**Card Content**:

Workout Frequency: A horizontal slider. The track is a thin line, and the thumb is a glowing cyan circle. As the user drags the slider, the corresponding label above it updates in real-time (e.g., "3 days/week").

Preferred Workouts: A multi-select grid of chips (e.g., "Weightlifting," "Running," "Yoga," "Cycling"). Selected chips behave like the gender selection in the previous step.

Sports: A searchable text input field that suggests sports as the user types.

Icons: A BarChart icon is in the header.

### Step 4: Nutrition Profile

**Visuals**: A card titled "Your Fuel" appears. The mountain's primary ridges and valleys are now visible in the wireframe.

**Card Content**:

Dietary Preferences: A set of toggle chips (e.g., "Vegetarian," "Vegan," "None").

Allergies: A text input field with auto-suggestions for common allergens.

Meals Per Day: A stepper control with + and - buttons to select the number of meals. The number in the middle pulses gently when changed.

Cooking Habits: A segmented control with two options: "Cook at Home" and "Eat Out." The selected option glows cyan.

Icons: An UtensilsCrossed icon is in the header.

### Step 5: Goal Setting & Summit Definition

**Visuals**: The final input card, "Your Summit," animates in. The mountain wireframe is now almost complete, looking like a detailed topographical map.

**Card Content**:

Primary Goal: A large, segmented control at the top to select the primary objective category: "Strength," "Endurance," "Skill," "Physique," or "Health." The selected option is highlighted prominently.

Specific Goal: A conversational input field appears where users can describe their specific goal in natural language (e.g., "Add 15 yards to my golf drive," "Run a sub-4 hour marathon," "Increase vertical jump by 3 inches"). The AI analyzes this input in real-time, highlighting key metrics it can track.

Target Achievement: An interactive slider allowing users to set their specific target (e.g., 15 yards for golf drive, 50 pounds for deadlift). The AI suggests a realistic target based on the goal complexity.

Activity Points Required: The system automatically calculates the total activity points needed to reach the summit based on the goal complexity and target achievement (e.g., 1,500 points for a 15-yard golf swing improvement).

Milestone Definition: The AI automatically suggests 3-5 measurable milestones with specific point thresholds that will mark progress toward the summit, which the user can adjust if needed.

Icons: A Flag icon (representing the summit goal) is in the header.

### Step 6: The Path is Set (Finalization)

**Visuals**: This is a full-screen cinematic moment. After the final input, the "Your Summit" card dissolves into hundreds of cyan light particles.

**Animation**:

The particles flow towards the wireframe mountain, "infusing" it.

As the particles hit, the mountain rapidly transforms from a wireframe into its final, fully textured, photorealistic 3D render.

The camera performs a slow, dramatic pan upwards from the base of the mountain as the Cyan Glow path is drawn onto its surface.

Text Overlay: The words "Your path is set." fade in over the mountain, then fade out.

Transition: The view seamlessly transitions into the Home Screen, where the user sees their newly created mountain for the first time as the UI cards animate into place.
